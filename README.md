# storj-nodejs binding

## Initial Set-up

**NOTE**: for Golang

Make sure your `PATH` includes the `$GOPATH/bin` directory, so that your commands can be easily used [Refer: Install the Go Tools](https://golang.org/doc/install):
```
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

Install [storj-uplink](https://godoc.org/storj.io/storj/lib/uplink) go package, by running:
```
$ go get storj.io/storj/lib/uplink
```

**NOTE**: for Nodejs 

* Please ensure Node.js with version 10 or higher is [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* Check its version
```
$ node -v
```

* Install the storj-nodejs Node.js package
```
$ npm install storj-nodejs
```


## Set-up Files

* Copy the sample *HelloStorj.js* file from ```node_modules/storj-nodejs/``` folder to the location, where from npm package was installed

* Create '.so' file at  ```$HOME/go/src/storj.io/storj/lib/uplinkc``` folder, by using following command:
```
$ go build -o libuplinkc.so -buildmode=c-shared 
```

* Copy *libuplinkc.so* file into the folder, where the sample *HelloStorj.js* file is copied


## Sample Hello Storj!
The sample *HelloStorj.js* code calls the *libUplinkNode.js* binding module to do the following:
    * create a new bucket within desired Storj project
    * write a file from local system to the created Storj bucket
    * read back the object from the Storj bucket to local system for verification
